        <p>The revelation started
            The revelation came to the prophet in 6 types
            True dreams or visions which is 1/46 of prophethood
            The angel would appear in the form of an man and some companions would see it
            The angel inspired the prophet by casting in his heart the ayat without seeing him
            Hearing the sound of bells or when iron was struck it was most difficult and he would sweat
            Even in a cold day, In this type of revelation a camel would sink if prophet sat on it
            The companions leg would be crushed if prophets leg was on top of it
            The prophet would see the angel in its true form
            The Prophet saw Jibril in his true form twice with 600 wings, this is mentioned in Surah Najam
            What Allah reveals to His Messenger directly
            This happened in the night journey in the miraj
            When the Prophet was ascended to the 7th heaven 
            He entered where Jibril could not enter
            He was received by Allah although he did not see Allah
            All he could see was light 
            Allah prescribed to his ummah 50 prayers a day 
            Then reduced to 5 daily prayers
            This is what gives salah a great priority over all other forms of worship
            Allah prescribed the salah to him directly 
            When the revelation started the Prophet did not preach to them directly 
            Because the tribes were the leaders and the leaders were rude
            They would have persecuted them
            The prophet warned the people in secret 
            The first person he called was his wife Khadija
            His best friend Abu Bakr
            His cousin Ali
            His adopted son Zaid bin Harith
            They all did they job secretly for 3 years
            130 men and women accepted Islam in secret 
            Prayer was given as 2 units in any part of the day 
            The message of to purify your soul and cleanse your heart
            To know Allahâ€™s beautiful names and attributes 
            To know your messenger and prophet Muhammad
