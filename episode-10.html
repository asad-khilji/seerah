      <p>After the Prophet tried he level best to call his people to Islam in Makkah
        The people in Makkah refused and were hostile
        In Shawwal during 10 year of prophethood 
        After the death of his uncle and wife he went to Taif
        A mountainous region about 60 km from Makkah
        He went with Zaid bin Harith
        When he reached there and proclaimed his dawah to 3 of the leaders of Taif
        The leaders of Taif insulted him and made fun of him
        As the prophet left the leaders of Taif told their people and children to throw stones at his feet
        This made the Prophet bleed
        Ayesha asked the prophet if anything was more difficult than the battle of Uhud
        In the battle of Uhud 70 companions were killed including Hamza bin Abdul mutalib
        Taif was worse than Uhud for the prophet
        The prophet woke up in an area near Makkah or Mina
        This was after a 4 hour walk from Taif
        The prophet heard a voice from above 
        When the prophet looked up it was Jibril
        Allah had ordered the angel of the mountains to obey Muhammad
        He said if you want I could crush the people of Taif with the mountains 
        The prophet said no I hope that Allah would bring from their offspring true Muslims
        This shows the heart of the prophet was filled with love for the whole world
        The prophet continued to give dawah to the people in Makkah
        After 1 month it was the season of Hajj
        People came from all over Arabia to perform hajj 
        Although they worshipped the idols 
        The prophet spoke to the people of each tribe 
        One of the tribes came from Madinah which was known as Yathrib
        6 men from Madinah from the tribe of Al Khajraj
        The prophet spoke to the tribe from Madinah 
        The prophet said would you be interested in listening to what I have 
        The tribe agreed
        The moment the tribe heard the Quran and about tawheed 
        It was very logical and it made sense
        There were two tribes Aus and Khajraj
        Madinah had tribes of Arabs and Jews
        The Jews were fuel the fighting between the Aus and Khajraj 
        The Jews told the Arabs of Madinah a Prophet is coming and we will destroy you 
        The Arabs of Madinah found out about the prophet and hastened to accept Islam
        The tribe went back to Madinah and every house there of the Ansar was mention of Prophet
        In 11th year of prophethood in Shawwal the prophet married Ayesha bint Abu Bakr
        Ayesha was 6 years old and the marriage was consummated was she was 9 years old
        This marriage was prescribed by Allah
        In this year a miraculous event took place 
        Jibril entered the house of the prophet one night accompanied by a ride called burqa
        The buraq with Jibril took the prophet from Makkah to Jersusalem
        It was the speed faster than lightening
        The prophet entered masjid al aqsa and led all the prophets and messengers in salah
        The prophet then ascended to the heavens
        1st then 2nd up to the 7th
        The prophet met different prophets in each heaven
        Then he ascended above the 7th heaven where he prostrated 
        Until he was instructed to rise up
        The prophet could see nothing but light
        Allah spoke to the prophet and revealed to him 50 prayers a day
        Musa advised the prophet to ask Allah for a reduction
        He kept going back and forth until it was reduced to 5 times a day
        Then the prophet came back down to earth all in one night
