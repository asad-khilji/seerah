       <p>There will be questions in the grave
        Who is your Lord?
        What is your religion?
        Who was this man that was sent to you?
        By studying the seerah we learn about the prophet
        When we know him then we come to love him
        The prophet said we will not attain faith until we love the prophet more than anyone 
        Everything has been documented with very little differences and this is a miracle
        No one elseâ€™s life is documented like this
        Studying the seerah shows us how the Quran can be implemented 
        The seerah gives us a wholistic view of the different sciences in Islam
        The prophet is our benchmark on how we make decisions 
        We were unfortunate to meet the prophet
        We get a chance to live with the prophet by studying the seerah
        The book by Ibn Ishaq is one of the most authentic seerah book
        With few weak narrations
        May this course be beneficial to learn about the prophet
