       <p>Prophet Muhammad was returned to his mother at the age of 4 years old
        After two years Aminah visited her family in Madinah with her son
        They stayed there for a month
        Whoever went to Madinah at that time would get a illness
        Sometimes it may be fatal
        This illness struck Aminah
        Then she went back to Makkah 
        The distance between Makkah and Madinah is 500 km
        By camel this would take 3 days
        Along the way to Makkah in Al Abwa Aminah died and was buried
        Prophet Muhammad was taken back to his grandfather 
        His grandfather was attached to Prophet Muhammad
        Muhammad would sit on his chair and his uncles would try to bring him down
        Abdul Mutalib said leave him as this child will have a bright future
        It happens by looking at the childâ€™s face sometimes 
        Abdul Mutalib died when Muhammad was 8 years old
        Before his death he told his son Abu Talib to take care of Muhammad
        Muhammad and his uncle were poor
        Muhammad worked as a shepherd then as a tradesmen 
        When Muhammad was 14 years old Abu Talib took him to Syria
        Bahira the monk recognized the seal of prophethood on Muhammad
        And he ordered Abu Talib to take him back to Makkah
        Because if the Jews knew of Muhammad they would kill him
        Abu Talib brought Muhammad back to Makkah
        Prophet Muhammad witnessed an alliance
        The alliance of Hilf ul Fudul
        This was formed in Dhul Qaidah which is a sacred month 
        The clans of Banu Hashem and other tribes gathered and formed this alliance 
        They would avenge those who were oppressed 
        This was a noble cause and Muhammad accepted it and witnessed it 
        Muhammad was present when the alliance was formed and praised it 
        It is permissible to join an international treaty if it is just
        Muhammad was born and raised in Makkah
        The norm of the youth of Makkah was to drink and party all night 
        And to worship idols and listen to music
        Allah protected the prophet from all of this 
        Muhammad did not ever drink, party, or worship an idol
        Muhammad did not eat anything slaughtered by an idol or anything other than name of Allah
        Muhammad tried one time to attend a concert but Allah put him to sleep
        So he never attempted it again
        Quresh gathered to rebuilt the Kaaba after a flood and Muhammad helped lift the rocks
        Al Abbas told him to take off his waist cloak and use that to help lift the rocks
        When he attempted to do this he fainted because it would expose his private parts
        It was norm to expose your private in public 
        Muhammad was known as the truthful and honest
