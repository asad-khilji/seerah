      <p>The 6 blessed men of Madinah spread the dawah throughout Madinah
        Then they waited 1 whole year until next Hajj
        Because they could not come in broad daylight under the watchful eye of Quresh
        They came in the 12th year of prophethood this time as 11 of them
        They wanted something more and something binding
        The prophet said give me your pledge of allegiance 
        He said not to associate anything with Allah
        This is the essence of Islam
        Do not steal
        Do not transgress others
        Do not commit fornication or adultery
        Do not kill your own children
        Do not commit sins
        So not disobey the Messenger in what is right or proper
        The prophet never ordered to do anything that is inappropriate 
        Whoever fulfills this pledge then his reward is with Allah
        But whoever commits any of those sins and is punished in this world it will an expiation for him
        Whoever commits these sins and Allah conceals it then it is up to Allah to forgive him or not
        The accepted the pledge and gave him their allegiance 
        They went back to Madinah and their numbers were growing
        The prophet sent with them a teacher to teach them their Islam
        The prophet sent Musab ibn Umair
        Musab was one of the youth of the companions
        Musab was one of the richest families of Makkah
        Before Islam he was a playboy who were the fanciest of clothes and best of perfumes
        People could smell the fragrance of Musab
        After accepting Islam his family was shock 
        His family tried to squeeze him out of it
        Musab gave it all up for Allah
        Musab went with the people back to Madinah
        Musab stayed with As’ad ibn Zurrara
        As’ad ibn Zurrara’s cousin was Saad ibn Mouadh, the head of the Aus tribe
        They said what is As’ad doing leaving their beliefs for a new religion
        His tribe tried to tell him to stop
        A person from his tribe came to him aggressively 
        As’ad came nicely and diplomatically 
        As’ad said if you like what you hear I will stay but if you do not I will leave
        He said ok that is fair
        They sat and He heard the Quran and immediately Saad was transformed 
        He accepted Islam, took a bath changed his clothes and prayed 2 rakah
        When he went back to Saad Saad said you came with a different face with what you left with
        He said that I spoke with Musab and As’ad and they said they will stop
        But the tribe was planning to kill them
        Saad took his spear and went to check if his cousin was in danger
        Saad saw that Musab and As’ad were safe
        Musab and As’ad sat down with Saad and told him nicely
        If you like what you hear we will continue and if not we will leave in peace
        Saad ibn Mouadh heard the Quran and accepted Islam
        Saad went back to his tribe and said I will not speak to anyone until you accept Islam
        Before sunset the whole tribe accepted Islam
        There was a 2nd pledge of alliagance in the 13th year of prophethood
        Now 72 people came from Yathrib
        They met in the darkness of the night with the prophet
        They also gave the pledge of allegiance to the prophet 
        The prophet would protect them
        They would protect the prophet if he came to Madinah 
        The people of Makkah saw the quick migration of the Muslims
        They were heading to Madinah
        They felt the vaccum 
        All the brains and wealth of the people had left 
        They felt the financial and political threat 
        They met in Dar un Nadwa and each person gave an idea
        One person said we should tie him up and feed him until he dies
        Another said we need to make him leave Makkah and boycott him and exile him
        Abu Jahl was with them and listening
        An old Bedouin came in who identified himself as a wise man
        Abu Jahl said I suggest we pick a strong young man from each of the tribes
        These groups of men with a sword would go at night and assiginate the prophet wile asleep
        This way they could not avenge them because his blood is scattered among different tribes
        It would just be blood money
        The old man who was the devil said this is the opinion that no one would stand against
