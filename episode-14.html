        <p>During the 1st year of hijra
            The prophet arrived in Madinah in Rabi Al Awwal
            The prophet sent expeditions
            These expeditions were small in the number men
            But it had a significant role in sending a message
            The first expedition was led by Hamza bin Abdul Mutalib
            Hamza led about 30 men and went to intercept one of the caravans of Quresh
            They did not have any real fight
            The following expedition was by Rabir
            Rabir is a small town which is the miqaat those coming for umrah or hajj
            This expedition was led by the cousin of prophet Ubaida bin Harith bin Abdul Mutalib
            Third expedition was in Harar and it was led by Saad bin Abi Waqas 
            Saad is one of the 10 promised paradise 
            The 4th expedition was in Abwa and took place in the 2nd year of hijra 
            The prophet led this expedition and the flag bearer was Hamzah Bin Abdul Mutalib
            The fifth expedition was in Buath and led by the prophet
            The sixth expedition was in Sufwan led by the prophet and it was the first campaign of Badr
            Then we have the battle of Badr
            Then we have the 7th expedition of Asheera led by the prophet
            The 8th expedition was of 12 men from companions of Makkah
            It was led Abdullah bin Jahsh
            The prophet gave him a letter and said not to open it until two days
            After two days he opened the letter and it directed them 
            They had to monitor the movement of the caravans 
            His companions were given a choice to continue or go back home
            None of them were reluctant to go back home
            This was at the last days of the month of rajab
            4 months are sacred in which fighting is prohibited 
            These months are Dhul Qaedah, Dhul Hijjah, Muharram, and Rajab
            They met a caravan with goods and money mostly raisins and some spices 
            Abdullah bin Jahsh proceeded and attacked the caravan and killed one of the idol worshippers
            They captured two prisoners of war
            The prophet and his companions were persecuted in Makkah for nothing
            Now in Madinah it was pay back time
            Quresh love their wealth
            To punish Quresh the prophet attacked their commercial caravan coming from Syria
            These expeditions teach you what surrounds you
            The type of soil and the mountains 
            Where it is best to position when fighting an army
            In these expeditions a message was sent to all the tribes that there is a strong force 
            So that they feel safe
            One of the idol worshippers raided a place where the prophet donated sheep and camels
            Then the prophet went to pursue them and to punish them
            After the campaign people recognized it and stopped such attempt
            The message was also sent to the Jews and hypocrites of Madinah
            It was revealed to the prophet after the expedition of Abdullah ibn Jahsh 
            That fighting is allowed but do not transgress
