        <p>After calling the people in secret and the revelation continues to come time after time
            The stories of the nations before us
            The stories of all the prophets and messengers made the foundation for the prophet
            What happened to the prophets happened to our prophet
            The rejection of the people to his peaceful call
            Allah revealed an ayah And warn O Muhammad your closest relative 
            The Prophet anticipated them rejecting his call
            One day the prophet climbed mount safa and shouted to the people be on your guard
            This is what someone says when there is an army coming to attack
            Then he calls the tribes of Makkah by name
            Everyone came out of their homes and listened to the Prophet
            The prophet said if I told you there is an army at the bottom of this mountain coming to attack
            Would you believe me 
            They replied yes as you are the trustworthy
            Then the prophet said I am a warner to you 
            Then he called them to the truth and warning of the punishment of Allah
            Then he becomes more specific in warning people
            He calls each individual specifically 
            He says I cannot avail you anything before Allah
            Safe yourself from the fire
            Such a speech given to the people given on that glorious day
            Announcing to them publicly 
            Muhammad says I am the Messenger of Allah
            Do not associate others with Allah
            Muhammad says I cannot benefit you nor can I benefit myself
            The prophets voice was resonating all over the place
            No one heard of this message before 
            No one could give any reaction 
            Except for Abu Lahab his uncle who said may you perish for the rest of the day
            Was it for this that you called us together?
            This is why Allah revealed a whole surah cursing Abu Lahab
            Abu Lahab could have accepted Islam to prove it wrong, but he did not 
            Because Allah knew that Abu Lahab would never accept the truth 
            The prophet would continue to go out and give dawah to his people 
            The prophet proclaimed the same message as all the prophets to worship Allah alone 
            The prophet would pray openly at the Kaaba 
            His people heard the Quran
            Something they never heard before 
            This was a shock to his people that need to be confronted because it went against their ancestors way
