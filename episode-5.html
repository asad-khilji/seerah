        <p>The message of Prophet Muhammad is divided into two
            The Makkah period and Madinah period
            The prophet lived for 53 years in Makkah
            Then he migrated to Madinah and lived there for 10 years
            Each era whether in Makkah or in Madinah has its characteristics 
            The prophet was known to be known the truthful and the honest 
            Allah prepared the prophet the 40 years before prophethood
            Allah took care of the prophet and protecting him
            Protecting him from useless entertainment, drinking, and worshipping idols 
            When the prophet was 40 years old he loved to be alone
            He contemplated on the creation of Allah
            He would go for seclusion for a month or so at the cave of Hira
            The prophet was met with Jibril in the form of a man at Hira when 40 years old
            The angel grabbed him and said to him recite
            The prophet said I am not a reciter 
            It was said again and a third time
            Then it was said Recite in the name of Your Lord who created 
            Who created man from a drop of fluid
            Recite in the name of Your Generous Lord 
            Who taught by the pen
            Who taught man that which he did not know
            The beginning of surah Alaq
            So the prophet was appointed as a prophet
            The prophet was startled and he went back to Khadija
            He was afraid of what he had seen 
            He was afraid of being called insane 
            Khadija supported the prophet and made him steadfast
            She said Allah will never disgrace you
            She mentioned all the nice qualities of the prophets
            You help the needy and help the people
            You feed the hungry
            Then there was a period of time when revelation stopped coming 
            Perhaps it was a month
            The pause was there so that the prophet could relax 
            So now the prophet was eager to receive revelation again
            The prophet heard a sound but saw no one or anything
            Then the prophet raised his head and saw Jibril covering the entire horizon
            Jibril was sitting on his throne with 600 wings jewels fell from those wings 
            The prophet was terrified and he went back to Khadija 
            The prophet said to Khadija cover me cover me
            It was then revealed the beginning of surah Muddathir 
            So the prophet was appointed as a Messenger
