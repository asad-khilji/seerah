        <p>Prophet Muhammad said all the idols are false deities
            Allah is the only one true God
            The one who gives life and death
            We have no choice but to worship Him
            Prophet said I am the Messenger of Allah and servant of Allah
            The people of Makkah were hostile and violent people
            The whole of the community were led by violent and aggressive men
            They reacted in a hostile way
            They started brutally persecuting the Muslims
            They dealt with the Muslims in a harsh
            The Prophet was also abused physical and verbally by them
            The Prophet was praying in the Kaaba and the idol worshippers discussed to insult the prophet
            One of them took the placenta of the she camel and dumped on the prophet while he prayed
            Then they started to laugh 
            The Prophet continued to make sujood and could not get up
            Fatima found out and she came running and removed it from his back
            Then the prophet raised his hands and said O Allah punish Quresh
            They were terrified by the dua yet they did not stop persecuting the Muslims
            The prophet chose a place for his companions to join and learn their religion
            The place was the house of ibn Arqam
            The Muslims organized their activities freely their in private
            The prophet allowed his companions to migrate to Abyssinia 
            In Abyssinia or Ethiopia their was a just Christian king 
            The Muslims were honored by the king in Abyssinia 
            The first to go were Uthman bin Affan and his wife Ruquayah bint Muhammad 
            This migration started 5 years after the Prophetâ€™s mission
            This first migration was for few months until they heard false rumors 
            They heard Quresh accepted Islam
            When they came back it was not the case so they went back to Abyssinia 
            This time 82 people went and migrated there 
            Quresh was upset and went after them 
            They sent two of their men trying to pursue the king
            They sent Amr bin Al As and another man
            Amr bin Al As was turned down and he sent them back with their gifts
            The king of Abyssinia had accepted Islam and Muslims were safe there 
            Two great men accepted Islam
            Hamza bin Abdul Mutalib and Umar bin Khattab
            The mention of these great men puts fear in the hearts of Quresh 
            Quresh could no longer continue to torture the Muslims
