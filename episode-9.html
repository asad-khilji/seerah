        <p>In Makkah the Muslims were ordered by Allah not to fight back
            Quresh made an unjust covenant and they hung it in the Kaaba 
            In that covenant was that they would not marry from Bani Hashem and Bani Muttalib 
            Hashem had a brother named Mutalib 
            Hashem had a son in Madinah and Hashem came back to Makkah
            Muttalib found Hashem’s son and brought him back 
            People saw and thought he was his servant instead of his nephew 
            So the name stuck with him Abdul Muttalib 
            Bani Hashem and Bani Muttalib were cousins and they treated them as one in the covenant 
            Quresh boycotted them and they did not sit with them or enter their homes 
            Until they surrender the prophet so they could kill him 
            Bani Hashem and Bani Muttalib suffered a lot from the boycott 
            They had nothing to eat except leaves of trees 
            Some things were sneaked in from their relatives and friends 
            But this was not enough 
            The boycott went on for three years 
            Some honest men who were idol worshippers wanted to help end the boycott 
            They all plotted 
            One men stood up and said what is happening is unfair 
            6 of them stood up and proclaimed that this is unfair 
            Quresh then felt sorry for them 
            They went to the Kaaba to take down this covenant 
            But they saw that a worm ate most of it except for Allah’s name 
            They were released from the boycott 
            6 months after the boycott Abu Talib felt sick and died 
            3 days later Khadija bint Khuwaylid died 
            The prophet was 50 years old at that time
            This was 3 years before migrating to Madinah 
            The financial, physical, and emotional support of the prophet was taken away 
            The prophet tried to get Abu Talib to say the shahadah but he refused 
            The prophet then sought to get support from other means
