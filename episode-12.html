      <p>The idol worshippers of Makkah have decided to kill the prophet
        Allah would not leave His servant unprotected
        Since a few months Abu Bakr asked the prophet to migrate
        The prophet said wait maybe Allah would send a companion with you
        The prophet went to visit Abu Bakr at the time of noon at an unusual time
        The prophet said to Abu Bakr to clear the room
        Abu Bakr said they are mine family and your family
        The prophet gave him the glad tidings that he has the permission to migrate
        Abu Bakr said companionship and allow me to be your companion
        The prophet said yes
        The enemies of Islam spent the day on plotting to kill the prophet
        The prophet would sleep after Isha then wake up at midnight and pray night prayer
        That day he instructed Ali bin Abu Talib to sleep in his bed & cover himself with his green cloak
        Anyone that would see would think that it is the prophet 
        The prophet told him not to be afraid for no harm would come to you
        The enemies of Islam were surrounding the prophet’s house
        It was impossible for him to leave unnoticed
        Yet he was protected by Allah
        The prophet came out of his house taking a hand full of dust and spread it over their heads
        Repeating the ayah in surah Yaseen we put ahead and behind them a barrier so they did not see
        The prophet went between them putting the soil on their heads
        They did not feel it or see it
        The prophet went to Abu Bakr’s house and they left in the darkness of the night 
        When the people would discover the prophet had left Makkah they would pursue him
        They thought the prophet would go north towards Madinah
        They prophet changed the route went south
        It was against all of their anticipated journey
        The prophet went to Mount Thawur in the direction of Yemen and hid in the cave
        It was a harsh terrain and it was very difficult to climb
        The prophet incountered a lot of difficulties
        They did not have special shoes to protect their feet
        They hid their for three days and three nights until the search was down
        Asma bint Abu Bakr would bring food to the prophet and her father
        Abdullah bin Abu Bakr would bring them news and tell them what Makkah is seeing
        Abu Bakr’s freed slave Amir would take the sheep and raise them and go back to Makkah
        So the sheep would cover the traces of Asma and Abdullah
        So no one would track their footprints 
        Also so that the prophet and Abu Bakr could drink the milk of the sheep
        After the 3 days the prophet got his ride along with Abu Bakr and a smart guide
        They took a different route that no one knew
        They travelled along the seashore, which was unusual for caravans to travel
        They travelled in secrecy until they reached Madinah
        The people of Madinah heard of the coming of the prophet
        So every morning. They would go to the southern area of Madinah
        Anticapting the Prophet’s arrival
        Until one day it was hot and sunny in the day
        A Jew saw the prophet coming up from the castle
        He shouted O people of the Arabs here is your honor you were anticipating 
        At first everyone greeted Abu Bakr thinking he was the prophet
        Until Abu Bakr shaded the prophet with his garment to protect him from the sun
        Then they knew that he was the prophet
        The Muslims came and everything was calm 
        There was tranquility 
        Then Allah revealed indeed Allah is his protector then Jibril and the righteous of the believers
        And the angels are his assistance 
        The prophet entered Madinah and the name was changed from Yathrib to Madinah 
        Every place the prophet went the people shouted the takbeer
        Every house of the Ansar that the prophet passed the people to stop the camel of the prophet
        But the camel would not stop 
        The prophet said leave it
        This camel has been ordered by Allah
        The camel kept on walking until it came to where the Masjid An Nabi is and it sat
        Then it got up walked a lot more and sat again 
        The prophet said this is the spot where Allah ordered the camel to sit in 
        The prophet’s maternal family was in Madinah
        So the prophet said who among you are our closest kinship
        Abu Ayyub Al Ansari said my house O Prophet of Allah
        The prophet went and was hosted by Abu Ayyub Al Ansari in his house
        The place where the camel sat was where the prophet would build Masjid Al Nabi
