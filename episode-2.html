        <p>Allah selected our Prophet from a lineage that had no haram in it
            There was no fornication or adultery from Adam to the Prophet Muhammad
            There were pure marriages and lineages 
            Prophet Muhammad is the best man ever to walk on the earth
            His name is Muhammad the son of Abdullah
            The son of Abdul Mutalib 
            The son of Hashim
            The son of Abdul Manaf
            The son of Qussay
            Th son of Kilab
            The son of Murrah
            The son of Ka’b
            The son of Lu’ayy
            The son of Ghalib
            The son of Fihr
            The son of Malik
            The son of An Nadr
            The son of Kinnan
            The son of Khuzaimah
            The son of Mudrikah
            The son of Ilyas
            The son of Mudar
            The son of Nizar
            The son of Ma’add
            The son of Adnan
            Adnan is of the offspring of Ismail
            Ismail is the son of Ibrahim
            No one can speak ill of the prophet because his lineage was pure
            Abdullah was one of the handsome men of Quresh
            Abdullah was known to be the one to be sacrificed 
            So was Ismail to be sacrificed
            Allah compensated these sacrifices with a Ram
            Abdul Mutalib gave a ransom of 100 camels to free him from his oath that he made
            To sacrifice Abdullah
            Abdul Mutalib was the leader of Quresh 
            Aminah bint Wahb was the mother of the Prophet Muhammad
            Wahb was the leader of Bani Zuhra
            Prophet Muhammad was born during the year of the elephant
            He was born on the 8th, 9th, or 12th of Rabi Al Awwal
            The Year of the Elephant was when Allah saved the Kaaba from destruction
            Against an army from Yemen accompanied with elephants 
            The elephants and the army were defeated by Allah who sent birds throwing stones at them
            This is mentioned in the Quran in Surah Fil
            When the Prophet was in his mother’s womb his father died
            His mother died when he was 6 years old
            His grandfather died when he was 8 years old
            Tragedy after tragedy to indicate that no one will care for him but Allah
            As mentioned in Surah Duha
            Allah says We found you as an orphan and sheltered you
            The prophet never celebrated his birthday
            Nor did the companions or their children and grand children
            The elite families of Arabia gave their children as infants to wet nurses to rural areas
            Where the air is fresh and food is clean
            They would learn proper Arabic
            This also happened with the Prophet Muhammad
            The Prophet Muhammad had two wet nurses 
            Suaiba who was the slave women of Abu Lahab the uncle of the Prophet
            Abu Lahab died as a kafr was was cursed by Allah in the Quran
            The second wet nurse was Halimah Sahdia
            She was a hired wet nurse 
            No one else accepted to take the prophet because he was an orphan
            With an orphan he was poor
            Halimah accepted to take Prophet Muhammad because she did not want to leave empty 
            The prophet Muhammad had two brothers through his wet nurses 
            Hamzah bin Abdul Mutalib and Abu Salamah
            The Prophet married the wife of Abu Salamah after he died 
            There was an incident when the Prophet was with Halimah
            Jibril came to the Prophet open his chest and washed his heart and washed it with Zam Zam 
            That was the portion that the devil would have utilized from you
            Which was then purified and cleansed 
            Halimah was afraid for his safety and gave him back to Aminah bint Wahb
