        <p>Now that the prophet entered Madinah it was not the time to rest
            It was time to build a nation
            The prophet first started with building a masjid 
            This instuition is the most important institution in Islam
            The Masjid in general
            The masjid is the origin of all goodness
            Its where we meet and learn 
            It is essential to have a masjid
            Masjid Al Nabi belonged to two orphans who gladly gave it to the prophet
            But the prophet would not accept it
            The prophet would give money in order to buy it from them
            The prophet himself participated in helping them build the masjid
            The prophet chant there is no life except the life of the hereafter 
            May Allah give it to the Ansar
            The prophet wanted to build a bond between the Muslims 
            To prevent any racisms or jealousy 
            The prophet paired a companion from Makkah to a companion in Madinah
            This brotherhood is a real brotherhood and they would inherit from each other
            They became real brothers
            Until Allah abrogated the inheritance part of it but there brotherhood remained 
            The community began to flourish from this brotherhood
            There is no hatred or ill feelings
            The Aus and Khajraj always fought bloody wars
            Now after accepting Islam they prayed in the same row
            It went well but there was still feelings of hatred 
            A convenant of Islamic unity was built
            The prophet formed a treaty to remove any hatred 
            In order to purify the hearts of the Ansar as a group 
            They displayed the highest amount of brotherhood
            The threat came from the non muslims in Makkah 
            And the Muslims were given the permission to fight back 
            This threat only indicates a huge amount of arrogance 
            This arrogance is like cancer that spreads and grows
            Allah teaches His servants to have honor and dignity and stand by their beliefs
            Allah promises the believers victory 
            The Muslims would establish prayer, give zakah, and establish good and forbid evil
